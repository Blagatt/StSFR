[b]TL;DR:[/b] Slay the Spire currently has loads of content and lots of polish. We want to use Early Access to make it even better. We will be releasing updates every two weeks with new content, fixes, and incorporating feedback. To thank our supporters, Slay the Spire will be discounted during EA!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that games that make best use of Early Access are the ones that actively engage with their communities. Frequent updates based on feedback and community input is exactly what we want to provide. By putting Slay the Spire into the hands of the players, we can make an already fun experience even better.



The game will be in Early Access for around 4-8 months. We have been working on Slay the Spire for over 2 years, and believe that this is the amount of time needed to finish up the game with all of the content and polish that we want.



The full version will have lots of additional and improved content, including a new character with an entirely new card set. Leaderboards, daily runs, and social features will be incorporated as the community grows. We will be directly looking to the community to determine how and when new features and content gets added.



Currently there are:

[list]
[*]Two core characters that each have their own unique set of cards.
[*]~200 cards, most with unique upgrades.
[*]50+ unique combat encounters.
[*]9 different bosses
[*]100+ different items to be found.
[/list]

At the current stage, Slay the Spire already has tons of content to explore and great replayability. Right now, fully beating the game takes an average of about 15-30 hours. The main focus of Early Access will be harnessing community feedback to improve the game even further.





Yes. Early Access supporters will receive a lower price. We plan to raise the price when the full game is released.




Working with the community is the heart of why Slay the Spire is going Early Access. Throughout the Early Access process we will be working with the community to improve the game.

[b]Content:[/b]
Community members will have the chance to have their own card ideas implemented into Slay the Spire! Details on this will be coming soon. 

[b]Balancing:[/b]
Nobody is better at discovering broken strategies than a thriving community. Through listening to your feedback, balance will be continually refined.

[b]Suggestions:[/b]
All ideas and feedback will be welcomed and seriously looked at. Maybe your sweet card idea will even make it into the game! 

[b]Bugs:[/b]
For the last 2 years we have been tirelessly fixing bugs with a team of internal testers. However, with so many permutations of cards and new content coming in, there is bound to be more issues. We believe that having a bug free experience is key in immersing yourself into the game. 

[b]Translation:[/b]
With so many cards (and text) there is a lot to translate. We want Slay the Spire to be seen by as many people around the world as possible, and we cannot do it without community support. Players that understand the game on a deep and technical level always create better translations than outsourcing to non-players. Stay tuned for more.
